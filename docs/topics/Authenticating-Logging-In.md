# Authenticating/Logging In

Upon product turnover, the designated profile for login is exclusively the __'admin'__ profile, which will be promptly provided. Once granted access to the website, the __'admin'__ has the capability to establish supplementary profiles for other officers to utilize.

## Logging In

To access the website, enter your respective credentials and click on the __'Log In'__ button. Additionally, an option to __'Remember me'__ is available, enabling users to have their login credentials remembered by their device. This allows swift access to the website without the need to input credentials every time.
